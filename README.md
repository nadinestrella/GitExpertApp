### ðŸ§ª About this project

This mini project has been a hands-on practice focused on learning and applying **testing in React applications**. Throughout the development, I worked with tools such as:

- **Jest** for running unit tests.
- **React Testing Library** to test components in an accessible and user-focused way.
- **Mocks and spies (`jest.fn`)** to simulate behavior.
- **Interaction testing**: inputs, forms, and events.
- **Testing conditional rendering and state management**.

The main goal wasn't to build a complex app, but rather to **understand and master the fundamentals of testing in the React ecosystem**, ensuring that components behave correctly in different scenarios.
